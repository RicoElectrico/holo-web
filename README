Holo Web is a few stylesheets that attempt to imitate the Android 4 “Holo” themes.


To add one of these themes to your page, you need to include two files:
- “holo-base.css”, which defines the sizes of the elements
- “holo-light.css” OR “holo-dark.css”, which will color the page like the corresponding Holo theme

You can, of course, merge the stylesheets into one file if you would like.

You can also include “roboto.css” and the “roboto” folder if you want the Android 4 “Roboto” font used on the page.

Enjoy!
